  <h1>My first week at epicodus</h1>
  <img src="epicodus_logo.png"="epicoduslogo">
    <p><strong>I learned how to do commands in terminal and how to open a new project in atom</p>
    <p>One of the most important things i learned in epicodus was the ability to cooperate with the partner i chose</strong></p>
      <p>At Epicodus <em> it is highly important</em> to work with your fellow partner</p>
         <li><strong><em>ALWAYS</em> remember to never leave your partner behind:</strong></li>
         <p> this step is highly important because you want your partner to know whats going on and make them understand the steps and codes
         <li>at epicodus it also important to ask others around you for help</li>
